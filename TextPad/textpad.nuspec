    <releaseNotes>##TextPad 8.5.0 (24-Sept-2020)##
Enhancements:

* Zooming is implemented with default shortcuts Ctrl + and Ctrl -. This can also be done using the new zoom toolbar. The default font size can be reinstated with Ctrl 0.
* In the File Preferences, there is a new option to save the list of recently used files in workspaces.
* The Save As dialog is now redisplayed when save is cancelled due to a character encoding conversion error.
* The setting for visual file comparisons is persisted between sessions.

Issues resolved:

* CSS syntax highlighting was lost after closing all open .css files, then opening one.
* The installation directory of JDK 14 was not detected.
* Tool output buffering prevented display of text a line at a time.
* The option to choose which instance of TextPad to open a file with was not added to Explorer's context menu.
